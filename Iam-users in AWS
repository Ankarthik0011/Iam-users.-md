# IAM – Users and Groups

## Creating IAM Users
1. Open AWS Management Console → IAM.
2. Go to “Users” → Click “Create User”.
3. Enter username and choose access type:
   - Console access (password)
   - Programmatic access (Access Key)
4. Attach policies:
   - AdministratorAccess (for testing)
   - Or custom policies

## Creating IAM Groups
1. Go to “User Groups” → “Create Group”
2. Assign a group name.
3. Attach required policies.
4. Add users to the group.

## IAM Best Practices
- Enable MFA for all users.
- Use groups instead of assigning policies to individuals.
- Rotate access keys regularly.
- Follow least privilege principle.

## What I Learned
- How to manage permissions securely.
- Difference between inline vs managed policies.
- How IAM integrates with other AWS services.
